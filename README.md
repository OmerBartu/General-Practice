# Practice Repository

This is the place where I upload my practices.  
They can be a mix of different things, such as:

- Random code snippets  
- Data structures practice  
- Algorithm practice  
- Experiments while learning Git  

Feel free to look around or use anything here.  
This repository is mainly for my personal learning and practice.
